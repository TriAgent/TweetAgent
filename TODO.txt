- bug: bot list name not changing when bot name changes in settings
- Ability to configure X accounts to get news from, from UI (store in summary news feature)

- release target date: january 15 - need to provide usage guidelines before that for PR.

P2:
- WS event for new airdrops + refresh on UI
- Don't ask for wallet address in replies if address has already been asked before in the conversation to avoid dead loop

P3:
- accounts list: ability to click a user id to reach his X profile.
- posts list : pagination and auto fetch more

AIRDROPS:
- other ideas:
  - support for NFT airdrops?
  - daily announcement of what token/amount is going to be done (also to remind to share posts)?
  - random monthly airdrop among all contest participants?
  - restore daily news summaries or not? Does this work well with users RTed contest posts?
- deploy new bot version to prod (double check bot name/account)

NEWS SUMMARiES:
- Hashtags:
  - agent to extract keywords from bot posts, so we can add # (hashtag) in front of some of them
  - extract news post hashtags and provide them as metadata to post loader when building summary. Writer agent might use some of them in the summary post. 

- Use case that could be improved?
  - Summary: "Vitalik plans to create "the splurge".
  - User question: "Where can i get more info about that new "splurge" tech?"
  - Bot reply: "You can check Ethereum's official blog or follow Vitalik Buterin on social media for updates on "The Splurge" tech. They often share insights and developments there."
    -> we might be able to extract some urls. For example in the original source post, we get the https://t.co/vvRijeahpS link that is a blog post that talks about the splurge.
    -> fetch news posts -> extract short urls -> scrap content and get real url + full page content -> analyze web page and save full + summary (+ vectorized for similar searches?) -> attach web page to post in DB -> X replier gets a tool for GPT to get a list of web pages related to some words -> gpt can build its answer using web page data or provide the url as reference.

- Use case to improve:
  - User reply: "What's the BTC price right now?"
  - Bot reply: "We don't provide market price advice, but if I had a crystal ball, I'd be on a beach sipping a cocktail instead of tweeting!"
    -> The question was not about future but current price...
    -> We could provide a token pricing tool to the replier.

- After generating a summary or reply, have a post processing agent to ask if the answer is meaningful text, to filter out hallucinations or buggy texts sometimes returned by GPT.
- replier:
  - more response types - but which ones? what do we want to say?

- List of potential useful tools:
  - Live crypto price access
  - Knowledge base of vector documents from recent blog posts, query by similar words
  - Build, a EVM smart contract
  - Sign and deploy a EVM smart contract
